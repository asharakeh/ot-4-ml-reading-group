# Computational Optimal Transport for Machine Learning Reading Group
Over the last few years, optimal transport (OT) has quickly become a central topic in machine learning. 
OT is now routinely used in many areas of ML, ranging from the theoretical use of OT flow for controlling learning algorithms 
to the inference of high-dimensional cell trajectories in genomics. This reading group aims to keep participants up 
to date with the latest research happening in this area.

### Code
- [POT: Python Optimal Transport](https://pythonot.github.io/): This open source Python library provide several 
   solvers for optimization problems related to Optimal Transport for signal, image processing and machine learning. 
   **This library has the most efficient exact OT solvers.**
- [GeomLoss](https://www.kernel-operations.io/geomloss/): The GeomLoss library provides efficient GPU 
   implementations for Kernel norms, Hausdorff divergences, and Debiased Sinkhorn divergences. **This library has 
   the most scalable duel OT solvers embedded within the Sinkhorn divergence computation.**
